Checks if a specific restaurant that just temporarily stopped taking orders due to excessive orders is back online on yemeksepeti

I was just ordering something on yemeksepeti, but when I clicked the "place order" button, I got a nasty warning saying that "this restaurant is temporarily unavailable due to excessive orders". I got super angry because after spending many hours on deciding what to get, I was being told that I cannot place my order! GIMME MY FOOD! 
Anyways, I decided instead of refreshing the page every second, I can write a simple python script to do it for me. And it did! It did wonders!

To run, simply edit the url, and run it on your favourite terminal.
